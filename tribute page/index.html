             <li><span class="bold">Life Circle - </span>Steve Jobs was the son of a teaching assistant at the University of Wisconsin and a student at the same institution who were not yet married. His father came from Syria, the city of Homs , his mother was American. They decided to give the baby up for adoption because the mother's parents did not consent to marriage. [4] The baby was adopted by the Jobs couple from Mountain View , who named him Steven Paul</li> 
              <li><span class="bold"> 1977 - </span>Jobs met Steve Wozniak , with whom he remained friends after high school. Jobs initially worked for Atari , but founded Apple Computer on January 3 , 1977 [6] , along with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne whom he had met at Atari.</li>
              <li><span class="bold"> 1978 - </span>On May 17, 1978, his girlfriend gave birth to their daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs .</li>
              <li><span class="bold">1985 - </span>In 1985, Jobs left Apple after the board of directors banned him from holding another leadership position at the company. He was succeeded by Sculley, and started the computer company NeXT .</li>
              <li><span class="bold">1997</span> , -  Like Apple, NeXT brought closed hardware to the market, but the BSD- based NeXTStep operating system was ahead of its time. Following an acquisition of NeXT by Apple, Jobs became interim CEO ( iCEO ) of Apple in the summer of 1997 , after CEO Gil Ameliohad been fired. He was later permanently appointed CEO of Apple with a salary of one dollar.</li>
              <li><span class="bold"> 1989 </span> - In October 1989, he met Laurene Powell, a student born in 1963 who attended a lecture by him at Stanford Business School.

They lived in Palo Alto and later had two daughters, Erin and Eve</li>
              <li><span class="bold">2007</span> - Jobs came up with the idea in February 2007 to develop a Wiki-like system specifically for school use that could be constantly updated. It would make textbooks redundant. This system under the name iTunes U – the U stands for University (Dutch: Universiteit) – can be reached via the Apple iTunes Store . Jobs believed that digital textbooks are much more current and engaging than traditional teaching materials. He hoped that a number of great American thinkers would participate.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">2004</span> - He underwent surgery in August 2004 to remove a tumor in his pancreas . He had a very rare form of pancreatic cancer and wanted to be cured without undergoing chemotherapy or radiation. He returned to work in September 2004 .</li>

This led to speculation about Jobs' health, and Apple's stock fell in value.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">2009 </span>- on January 5 2009, Jobs put an end to the rumors with an open letter on Apple's website. He wrote that research had shown that he suffered from a hormone disorder, which had caused him to lose a lot of weight. The condition is easy to treat, Jobs reported. In an accompanying statement from Apple management, the company refuted rumors that Jobs would like to resign.</li>
   
   <li><span class="bold">2009 - </span> On January 14, 2009, Jobs informed Apple employees in an email that his health problems were more complex than he initially thought and that he was taking a leave of absence until the end of June 2009. [7] On June 29, 2009, Jobs returned to work, after a liver transplant more than two months earlier in Memphis . [8] [9]</span></li>
              <li> <span class="bold"> 2011 - </span> On January 17, 2011, Jobs wrote an email to Apple employees that he was once again withdrawing from the company for medical reasons. The email stated that he wanted to return as soon as possible and that despite his absence, he would remain involved in Apple's strategic decisions and would remain as CEO. He handed over the day-to-day management to Tim Cook .</li>
              <li> <span class="bold">2011 </span>- On August 24, 2011, Jobs announced in a letter to the workforce and the world that he could no longer meet the demands of a CEO and that he was resigning from his position as CEO effective immediately. He indicated that he would like to stay on in another position if the management agreed. His position was taken over by former COO (Chief Operating Officer) Tim Cook, the letter said.</li>
              <li> <span class="bold">2011 - </span> On October 5, 2011, Apple executives reported that Steve Jobs had died that day from pancreatic cancer </li>

            <div class="quote-container">
              <p class="quote">A special characteristic of Jobs was the way he announced the latest developments within the Apple group. He did this during his keynote speeches, the so-called Stevenotes , which he gave at events such as the Apple Expo , MacWorld Expo , the Worldwide Developers Conferences and other press conferences. During these speeches, Jobs managed to captivate his audience in his own unique way. He usually concluded by leaving the stage and returning with his famous statement "One more thing...", after which he launched a new product. Including the MacBook Pro (Apple's first Intel-based computer), the iPod with video function, the iTunes WiFi Store,FaceTime and the MacBook Air (2010) were introduced as 'One More Thing'.</p>
